#Portfolio

This is a Portfolio that I created at School of applied technology on our first hackday.

##For this project I used: <br />
-Pug <br />
-CSS <br />
-Vanilla JavaScript <br />
-Express

##Background <br />
I had one day at School of applied technology to start a project and finish as much as I could before handing it in. <br />
It it me that 'everyone needs a portfolio and so do I'.

##Thoughts <br />
Focus of my portfolio was to be clean-looking, have a nice UX and be fully responsive.

##Features <br />
-Neatly placed content in sections <br />
-Clicks on navbar will scroll the screen to prefered section <br />
-Icons will bring you to Github and LinkedIn <br />
-Works with both desktop and mobile view

##Further implementations <br />
-Thumbnails for projects <br />
-Mail-icon should bring you to a mail pop-up
